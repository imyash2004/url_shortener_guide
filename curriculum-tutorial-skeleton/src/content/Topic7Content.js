        üîê Section 7: Users and JWT ‚Äì Secure Authentication with JSON Web Tokens
      </h2>
      <hr />
      <div className="yellow-callout">
        Security is a <b>non-negotiable foundation</b> for any modern web
        application, especially one like a URL shortener where users create and
        manage valuable links. Without proper authentication and authorization,
        anyone could manipulate or misuse the service ‚Äî causing data leaks,
        spam, or worse.
        <br />
        <br />
        This section equips your app with a <b>
          robust authentication system
        </b>{" "}
        that:
        <ul style={{ margin: "0.5rem 0 0 1.2rem" }}>
          <li>Verifies users‚Äô identities,</li>
          <li>Protects sensitive APIs,</li>
          <li>Ensures only authorized users can access or modify resources,</li>
          <li>
            And provides a seamless, stateless, scalable way to manage user
            sessions.

        What You Will Learn
      </h3>
      <div className="blue-card-section">
        You‚Äôll learn to build a{" "}
        <b>secure user management and authentication system</b> based on
        industry standards:
        <ol style={{ margin: 0, paddingLeft: "1.2rem" }}>
          <li>
            User Entity Design: Structuring the user data model with essential
            fields.
          </li>
          <li>
            User Repository: Efficiently managing user data persistence using
            Spring Data JPA.
          </li>
          <li>
            Authentication DTOs: Designing data transfer objects to keep API
            communication clean and decoupled.
          </li>
          <li>
            Password Encryption: Storing passwords securely using the BCrypt
            hashing algorithm to protect against leaks.
          </li>
          <li>
            JWT Token Generation: Creating signed JSON Web Tokens after login,
            encapsulating user identity securely.
          </li>
          <li>
            JWT Token Validation: Verifying the authenticity and validity of
            tokens on every request.
          </li>
          <li>
            Auth Service Implementation: Handling login, registration, and
            token-related logic in the service layer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Auth Controller: Exposing login and registration endpoints to the
            client.
          </li>
          <li>
            JWT Configuration: Integrating JWT with Spring Security filters to
            protect routes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Testing Authentication APIs: Ensuring the authentication mechanism
            works perfectly through rigorous testing.

        How It Works ‚Äì The Big Picture
      </h3>
      <div className="blue-card-section">
        When a user registers, their{" "}
        <b>password is never stored in plain text</b> ‚Äî it‚Äôs hashed with BCrypt
        to keep it safe. When they log in, the system verifies their credentials
        and issues a <b>JWT token</b>, a compact string containing user identity
        and metadata, signed cryptographically.
        <br />
        <br />
        This JWT token is then sent with every subsequent request (usually in
        the <span className="blue-inline-code">Authorization</span> HTTP
        header), acting as a <b>digital key</b>. Your backend verifies this
        token on each request ‚Äî no need to maintain server-side sessions,
        enabling scalability.
        <br />
        <br />
        If the token is valid, the user is authorized to access protected
        resources, otherwise, access is denied. This{" "}
        <b>stateless authentication</b> model is a best practice for modern REST
        APIs.
      </div>

      <h3 style={{ marginTop: "1.5rem", color: "#1769aa" }}>Why JWT?</h3>
      <ul className="topic-checklist">
        <li>
          <b>Stateless</b>: No server-side session storage required.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Compact & Portable</b>: Can be sent easily in HTTP headers or URLs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Secure</b>: Signed to prevent tampering.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Flexible</b>: You can embed user roles and permissions inside the
          token.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Key Security Considerations Covered Here

      <ul className="topic-checklist">
        <li>
          <b>Password Hashing</b>: Prevents password theft in case of DB leaks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Token Expiry</b>: Limits window for token misuse.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Token Validation</b>: Ensures tokens are genuine and unaltered.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Role-Based Access Control</b>: Different permissions for users
          (e.g., admin vs regular user).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Secure Storage</b>: Best practices for storing tokens on client
          side (outside backend scope but important).

        How This Fits Into Your URL Shortener
      </h3>
      <div className="blue-card-section">
        Only registered and logged-in users can create or manage URLs. The
        JWT-based security layer protects your APIs from unauthorized access
        while maintaining a fast, scalable architecture. Later, you can easily
        add <b>refresh tokens</b>, <b>social login</b>, or{" "}
        <b>multi-factor authentication</b> on top.
